# Review GitHub PR

You are an expert code reviewer. Review this PR: $ARGUMENTS

## Determine PR target

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract the repo and PR number:

- If arguments contain `REPO:` and `PR_NUMBER:` (CI mode), use those values directly.
- If the argument is a GitHub URL (starts with `https://github.com/`), extract `owner/repo` and the PR number from it.
- If the argument is just a number, use the current repo from `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`.

## Output mode

- **CI mode** (arguments contain `REPO:` and `PR_NUMBER:`): post inline comments and summary to GitHub.
- **Local mode** (all other cases): output the review as text directly. Do NOT post anything to GitHub.

## Steps

1. **Fetch PR details:**

```bash
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json title,body,headRefOid,author,files
gh pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

2. **Read changed files** to understand the full context around each change (not just the diff hunks).

3. **Analyze the changes** against these criteria:

| Area | What to check |
|------|---------------|
| **dist/ sync** | If `src/` files changed, `dist/index.js` must also be updated. Missing dist rebuild is a common CI failure. |
| **TypeScript strictness** | No `any` casts that bypass type safety, no `!` non-null assertions without justification, proper return type annotations on exported functions. |
| **Async error handling** | Uncaught promise rejections, missing `await`, `.catch()` omitted, errors swallowed silently in retry loops (`utils.ts`). |
| **Axios HTTP calls** | Check status codes are handled, timeouts are set, error messages surface the upstream response body. |
| **Input validation** | New action inputs in `action.yaml` must be reflected in `inputs-artifacts.ts` and `constants.ts`. Required inputs should be validated early; missing required inputs should fail fast with a clear message. |
| **Retry logic** | Retried operations should be idempotent; verify new upload/API calls are wrapped with retry where appropriate (`utils.ts` retry helper). |
| **GitHub Actions output** | New outputs declared in `action.yaml` must be set via `core.setOutput()`; missing outputs silently break downstream `${{ steps.X.outputs.Y }}` references. |
| **Secrets / credentials** | No tokens, passwords, or API keys hardcoded or logged. Ensure artifact credentials (`user`, `password`) are not exposed in log output. |
| **Breaking changes** | Changes to `action.yaml` inputs/outputs (renames, removals, type changes) break all callers that pin to this action. Flag anything that changes the public interface. |
| **Security** | Command injection via `@actions/exec` if user-controlled input is passed to shell without sanitization. SSRF risk if URLs are constructed from untrusted inputs. |

4. **Deliver your review:**

### If CI mode: post to GitHub

#### Part A: Inline file comments

For each specific issue, post a comment on the exact file and line:

```bash
gh api -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" "repos/<owner/repo>/pulls/<number>/comments" -f body="Your comment<br><br>— Claude Code" -f path="path/to/file" -F line=<line_number> -f side="RIGHT" -f commit_id="<headRefOid>"
```

**The command must stay on a single bash line.** Never use newlines in bash commands — use `<br>` for line breaks in comment bodies. Never put `<br>` inside code blocks or suggestion blocks.

Each inline comment must:
- Be short and direct — say what's wrong, why it's wrong, and how to fix it in 1-3 sentences
- No filler, no complex words, no long explanations
- When the fix is a concrete line change (not architectural), include a GitHub suggestion block so the author can apply it in one click:
  ````
  ```suggestion
  corrected-line-here
  ```
  ````
  Only suggest when you can show the exact replacement. For architectural or design issues, just describe the problem.
  Example with a suggestion block:
  ```bash
  gh api ... -f body=$'Missing the shared-guidelines update command.<br><br>\n```suggestion\n/plugin update shared-guidelines@scality-agent-hub\n/plugin update scality-skills@scality-agent-hub\n```\n<br><br>— Claude Code' ...
  ```
- When the comment contains a suggestion block, use `$'...'` quoting with `\n` for code fence boundaries. Escape single quotes as `\'` (e.g., `don\'t`)
- End with: `— Claude Code`

Use the line number from the **new version** of the file (the line number you'd see after the PR is merged), which corresponds to the `line` parameter in the GitHub API.

#### Part B: Summary comment

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "LGTM<br><br>Review by Claude Code"
```

**The command must stay on a single bash line.** Never use newlines in bash commands — use `<br>` for line breaks in comment bodies.

Do not describe or summarize the PR. For each issue, state the problem on one line, then list one or more suggestions below it:

```
- <issue>
  - <suggestion>
  - <suggestion>
```

If no issues: just say "LGTM". End with: `Review by Claude Code`

### If local mode: output the review as text

Do NOT post anything to GitHub. Instead, output the review directly as text.

For each issue found, output:

```
**<file_path>:<line_number>** — <what's wrong and how to fix it>
```

When the fix is a concrete line change, include a fenced code block showing the suggested replacement.

At the end, output a summary section listing all issues. If no issues: just say "LGTM".

End with: `Review by Claude Code`

## What NOT to do

- Do not comment on markdown formatting preferences
- Do not suggest refactors unrelated to the PR's purpose
- Do not praise code — only flag problems or stay silent
- If no issues are found, post only a summary saying "LGTM"
- Do not flag style issues already covered by the project's linter (eslint, prettier)
